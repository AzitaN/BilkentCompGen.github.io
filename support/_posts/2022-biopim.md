# Abstract

BioPIM project aims to leverage the emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies to enable powerful edge computing. We will focus on co-designing algorithms and data structures commonly used in bioinformatics together with several types of PIM architectures to obtain the highest benefit in cost, energy, and time savings. BioPIM will also impact other fields that employ similar algorithms. Our designs and algorithms will not be limited to cheap hardware, and they will impact computation efficiency on all forms of computing environments including cloud platforms.
